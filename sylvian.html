  <h3 id="a-speculative-interpretation-of-brilliant-trees">A speculative
interpretation of Brilliant Trees</h3>
<p>I am basing this essay on bits and pieces from various interviews or
posts on social media that Sylvian has made, as well as the content of
the songs themselves, of course. This is not an attempt at rigor, merely
a casual wandering through thought.</p>
<p>Although Sylvian’s project of the deconstruction of pop begins with
this album, Brilliant Trees is modernist in that it lines up many
different philosophies next to each other, it is modernist in that it
strives to make sense of various metanarratives and their relationships
to each other, from Sartrean existentialism, naturalism,
transcendentalism, abstract expressionism, new-agism, to hints of
Gnosticism. It takes the genre of pop on a subterranean journey through
a dark underworld, both lyrically and sonically.</p>
<p>One of the main influences lyrically is Sartre’s novel Nausea.</p>
<p>These both have themes of deconstruction or loss of meaning.</p>
<p>I tend to read this album as having a sole narrator.</p>
<p>The album begins with the song <em>Pulling Punches</em>, sporting an
upbeat party atmosphere, reflective of Japan in its earlier albums.
Lyrically it features a narrator who seems overwhelmed by the “nature
breeds this nausea”, a reference to Sartre’s work <em>Nausea</em>,
wherein a character experiences a vision induced by the observation of
the roots of a chestnut tree sinking into the ground. All words and all
meaning vanishes. “This veneer had melted, leaving soft, monstrous
lumps, in disorder — naked, with a frightful and obscene nakedness.”…
“This moment was extraordinary. I was there, motionless, paralyzed,
plunged in a horrible ecstasy. But at the heart of this ecstasy,
something new had just appeared; I understood the nausea, I possessed
it.”</p>
<p>The next track is titled <em>The Ink In The Well</em>. It happens to
feature one of the best performances that the bassist Danny Thompson has
performed. The track walks the line between jazz and pop. He references
the abstract painting of Picasso in the line “Picasso is painting the
flames in the harbor” referring to Guernica<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. He
returned to Picasso (or rather, Picasso’s wife who cared for him on his
deathbed) with an unofficially released track titled Jacqueline. I find
something Heideggerian in the line “The lights of the ashes smolder
through hills and vales”. Entities unveiling themselves in a clearing.
The Music Video features Sylvian waking up repeatedly in the same bed in
a small shack. The chorus lyrics: “The rope is cut, the rabbit is loose
(Fire at will in this open season) The blood of a poet, the ink in the
well (It’s all written down in this age of reason)”. Rabbits appear
again in Sylvian’s last album, as well as an unofficially released song
<em>Tear Me Apart</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

The design is reminiscent of both Picasso and Edvard Munch’s 1893
painting <em>The Scream</em>.</p>
<p>I discovered David Sylvian when I was searching for secondary
material on the philosopher and novelist George Bataille’s work <em>Blue
of Noon</em>, a strange work of postmodern anti-nazi eroticism. Sylvian
wrote a track titled <em>Blue of Noon</em> for the album that he never
got around to adding lyrics to. It is jazzier than even <em>Ink In The
Well</em>, but Sylvian didn’t like Jansen’s drumming as Jansen isn’t a
Jazz drummer and Sylvian felt as if he asked too much of him.</p>
<p>The track titled <em>Nostalgia</em> is the descent into night. The
party has wound down and most are now asleep<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
The song is underpinned by a constant low synth drone acting as the
bass.</p>
<p>Red Guitar reminds me of insomnia, the events of the party are
replaying subconsciously via the emotions.</p>
<p>The track backwaters is at the very least drifting between dream and
wakefulness and dream and nightmare, in a word, hypnogogic. Both the
melody of the synth bass, and a resonant envelope give it a snake-like
quality. “Once again I’m hiding in backwaters, running this way and
that”, the narrator tells us, on the edge of singing and speaking in a
whisper. “Trying so very hard to please”. Another voice emerges “Beware
of hidden snares”. “Rushing to bite the hand that feeds me, running this
way and that”, the narrator sings with more force. “There are always
other possibilities”, the voice informs. “This way and that” ends the
narrator. Various synth pads begin sliding around. They are joined by an
occasional stabbing melody reminiscent of horror-film soundtracks.</p>
<p>The titular track <em>Brilliant trees</em> begins with the flugelhorn
played brilliantly by Hassel that sounds eerily reminiscent of the
previous tracks snaking pads, but the horn is soon joined by a synth and
together they merge into harmony reminiscent of a rising sun. The
darkness is over. I would say the track merges humanism and naturalism.
It’s the eyes of a figure unknown to us that leads the narrator’s life
“back to the soil” “A reason to believe divorces itself from me, every
hope I hold lies in my arms. And there you stand, making my life
possible.”</p>
<p>Sartre’s novel and Picasso’s painting have in common that they both
see forms removed from their context, from their relationships. The
difference is that Picasso merely breaks a subject down into its
constituent parts in order to rearrange them or reform them, or to
combine parts from different subjects to form or reveal new
relationships. Sartre’s depiction of the mystical breaks from context
together. The forms are completely solitary, and thus without meaning,
revealing only a void.</p>
