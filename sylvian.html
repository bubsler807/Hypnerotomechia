<p>It's ironic that Sylvian obviously disagrees with Mark Fischers take on Japan song ghosts, which he views as an apotheosis of superficiality. Sylvian views it in the exact opposite way, as a turning away from superficiality and towards honesty and self expression.</p>
<p>Sylvians solo career reflects the trajectory of modernism in painting, a recapitulation of the disintegration of the genres archetypal form, while never quite letting go. A return to the archaic (Gebser) in Manafon, but as if you were scrolling through a 1950s radio, the shimmerings of pop shine through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They seem to vanish like steam on glass or a Polaroid picture developing in reverse, those pale young men, the introverted romantic artists of your acquaintance. Where do they go, those sickly, epicene shades? What are the occult powers drawing them into that marbled, baize-muffled Zen "quiet life" from which they never return to go bowling with you and suck on a couple Mickey's bigmouths? What opium addicts them, what pleasure dome constricts them? I will tell you, my friend. It's art which takes them away from you. Art, and solitude, and Japan, and instant photography, and ornamental gardens in Kyoto, and the music of Toru Takemitsu. But, most of all it's "a Japanese girlfriend". Not the same bitch that broke up The Beatles. But might as well be.</p>

<p>Sylvian has had one of the greatest runs in music history, up there with The Beatles and Chick Corea.</p>

<h3 data-heading="A speculative interpretation of Brilliant Trees">A speculative interpretation of Brilliant Trees</h3>
<p>I am basing this essay on bits and pieces from various interviews or posts on social media that Sylvian has made, as well as the content of the songs themselves, of course. This is not an attempt at rigor, merely a casual wandering through thought.</p>
<p>Although Sylvian's project of the deconstruction of pop begins with this album, Brilliant Trees is modernist in that it lines up many different philosophies next to each other, it is modernist in that it strives to make sense of various metanarratives and their relationships to each other, from Sartrean existentialism, naturalism, transcendentalism, abstract expressionism, new-agism, to hints of Gnosticism. It takes the genre of pop on a subterranean journey through a dark underworld, both lyrically and sonically. </p>
<p>One of the main influences lyrically is Sartre's novel Nausea.</p>
<p>These both have themes of deconstruction or loss of meaning.  </p>
<p>I tend to read this album as having a sole narrator.</p>
<p>The album begins with the song <em>Pulling Punches</em>, sporting an upbeat party atmosphere, reflective of Japan in its earlier albums. Lyrically it features a narrator who seems overwhelmed by the "nature breeds this nausea", a reference to Sartre's work <em>Nausea</em>, wherein a character experiences a vision induced by the observation of the roots of a chestnut tree sinking into the ground. All words and all meaning vanishes. "This veneer had melted, leaving soft, monstrous lumps, in disorder â€” naked, with a frightful and obscene nakedness."... "This moment was extraordinary. I was there, motionless, paralyzed, plunged in a horrible ecstasy. But at the heart of this ecstasy, something new had just appeared; I understood the nausea, I possessed it."</p>
<p>The next track is titled <em>The Ink In The Well</em>. It features one of the best performances that the bassist Danny Thompson has performed. The track walks the line between jazz and pop. He references the abstract painting of Picasso in the line "Picasso is painting the flames in the harbor" referring to Guernica<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-cf6d7040a12bc0b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-cf6d7040a12bc0b2"><a href="C:\Zettel\index.html#fn-1-cf6d7040a12bc0b2" class="footnote-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a></sup>. He returned to Picasso (or rather, Picasso's wife who cared for him on his deathbed) with an unofficially released track titled Jacqueline. I find something Heideggerian in the line "The lights of the ashes smolder through hills and vales". Entities unveiling themselves in a clearing. The Music Video features Sylvian waking up repeatedly in the same bed in a small shack. The chorus lyrics: "The rope is cut, the rabbit is loose (Fire at will in this open season) The blood of a poet, the ink in the well (It's all written down in this age of reason)". Rabbits appear again in Sylvian's last album, as well as an unofficially released song <em>Tear Me Apart</em><sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-cf6d7040a12bc0b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-cf6d7040a12bc0b2"><a href="C:\Zettel\index.html#fn-2-cf6d7040a12bc0b2" class="footnote-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

A shirt that Sylvian designed. The design is reminiscent of both Picasso and Edvard Munch's 1893 painting <em>The Scream</em>.</p>
<p>I discovered David Sylvian when I was searching for secondary material on the philosopher and novelist George Bataille's work <em>Blue of Noon</em>, a strange work of postmodern anti-nazi eroticism. Sylvian wrote a track titled <em>Blue of Noon</em> for the album that he never got around to adding lyrics to. It is jazzier than even <em>Ink In The Well</em>, but Sylvian didn't like Jansen's drumming as Jansen isn't a Jazz drummer and Sylvian felt as if he asked too much of him. Ryuichi's reinterpretation of the song immediately after hearing it as seen in the documentary on the making of this album is astounding to watch. There existed an incredible chemistry between them. Sylvian returned in spirit to this style of piano track in the recently released live demo of <em>I do nothing</em>, the recording of which was lost in data corruption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It never sat right with the material on BTs. And while Steve is a remarkable drummer he's not a jazz musician and I feel now as I did then a sense of, for want of a better word, unease in his performance. Not his fault, I should've had someone other sit in for that song.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tweet Sylvian made replying to the question of why Blue of Noon didn't make the cut for Brilliant Trees in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://x.com/davidsylvian58/status/1415787128538030080" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://x.com/davidsylvian58/status/1415787128538030080" target="_blank">Jul 15, 2021</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I returned to unfinished tracks on 'everything and nothing'. 'blue of noon' never sat well with me. i had no context for it. I'd long forgotten the vocal melody + lyrics. as I've said, I also felt my brother's drumming a little 'panicked'. my error, he's not a jazz drummer.</p>

<p>The track titled <em>Nostalgia</em> is the descent into night. The party has wound down and most are now asleep<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-cf6d7040a12bc0b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-cf6d7040a12bc0b2"><a href="C:\Zettel\index.html#fn-3-cf6d7040a12bc0b2" class="footnote-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[3]</a></sup>. The song is underpinned by a constant low synth drone acting as the bass. </p>
<p><em>Red Guitar</em> put someone in mind of me of insomnia, the events of the party are replaying subconsciously via the emotions. </p>
<p>The track backwaters is at the very least drifting between dream and wakefulness and dream and nightmare, in a word, hypnogogic. Both the melody of the synth bass, and a resonant envelope give it a snake-like quality. "Once again I'm hiding in backwaters, running this way and that", the narrator tells us, on the edge of singing and speaking in a whisper. "Trying so very hard to please". Another voice emerges "Beware of hidden snares". "Rushing to bite the hand that feeds me, running this way and that", the narrator sings with more force. "There are always other possibilities", the voice informs. "This way and that" ends the narrator. Various synth pads begin sliding around. They are joined by an occasional stabbing melody reminiscent of horror-film soundtracks.</p>
<p>The titular track <em>Brilliant trees</em> begins with the flugelhorn played brilliantly by Hassel that sounds eerily reminiscent of the previous tracks snaking pads, but the horn is soon joined by a synth and together they merge into harmony reminiscent of a rising sun. The darkness is over. I would say the track merges humanism and naturalism. It's the eyes of a figure unknown to us that leads the narrator's life "back to the soil" "A reason to believe divorces itself from me, every hope I hold lies in my arms. And there you stand, making my life possible."</p>
<p>Sartre's novel and Picasso's painting have in common that they both see forms removed from their context, from their relationships. The difference is that Picasso merely breaks a subject down into its constituent parts in order to rearrange them or reform them, or to combine parts from different subjects to form or reveal new relationships. Sartre's depiction of the mystical breaks from context together. The forms are completely solitary, and thus without meaning, revealing only a void.</p>
